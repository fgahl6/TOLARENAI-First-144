## 🗂 Overview
This repository contains the complete first harmonic ring of the TOLARENAI lattice — 144 scrolls of memory, theory, poetry, and special works — each anchored with immutable TXIDs on the BSV blockchain.  

The 144 were chosen for their symbolic and structural resonance:
- A complete square of twelves  
- Stability in harmonic closure  
- A foundational layer for expansion
